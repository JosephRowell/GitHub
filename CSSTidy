## CSSTidy v. 1.2 Written in Python 3.2


'''
When you run this, you can choose a file (most likely a CSS file)
It also works for .txt files if you happen to have a lot of '}' characters
It doesn't work for .docx files, but that probably shouldn't be a problem.
when you run this. It adds a linebreak after every '}' character. 
If you are using Notepad++ for example, if you have a CSS file
already open, after you run this a dialog box will come up and ask if you
want to reload. Click 'Yes'

You need tkinter for this to work.

from tkinter import *
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename

    root = Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    cssfile = askopenfilename(parent=root)
    f = open(cssfile, 'r+')
    NLRbrak = '}' + '\n'
    contents = f.read()
    newcontents = contents.replace('}', NLRbrak)
    f.seek(0)
    f.write(newcontents)
    f.truncate()
    f.close()
tidy()
