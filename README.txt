I have a few Python projects that I am working to improve. 

Right now, I'm in the process of creating a Python script to tidy up css files.
Another thing I'm going to try and do in my programming adventures is to 
make similar programs in different languages. 
I'm learning a lot, and I'm still kind of new at this, and I will
update this as often as I can
