I have a few Python projects that I am working to improve. 

CSSTidy is a very nifty program. It cleans up messy CSS files 
that require too much horizontal scrolling
Another thing I'm going to try and do in my programming adventures is to 
make similar programs in different languages. 
I'm learning a lot, and I'm still kind of new at this, and I will
update this as often as I can
